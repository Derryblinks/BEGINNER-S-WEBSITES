      </a>

      <pre>
        Christ is my firm foundation
        The Rock on which I stand
        When everything around me is shaken
        I’ve never been more glad
        That I put my faith in Jesus
        ‘Cause He’s never let me down
        He’s faithful through generations
        So why would He fail now?
    </pre
      >

      <pre>
        He won’t
        He won’t
    </pre
      >

      <pre>
        I’ve still got joy in chaos
        I’ve got peace that makes no sense
        So I won’t be going under
        I’m not held by my own strength
        ‘Cause I’ve built my life on Jesus
        He’s never let me down
        He’s faithful in every season
        So why would He fail now?
      </pre>

      <pre>
        He won’t
        He won’t
        He won’t fail
        He won’t fail
        He won’t
        No, no, no, no
        He won’t
        He won’t fail
        He won’t fail

Oh, rain came and wind blew
